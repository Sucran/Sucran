## About Me

**I've been working with technology since 2019**, and during this time I worked with the most diverse types of projects like: **Distributed Job Scheduling Systems, CloudNative Streaming Lakehouse Systems, and Big Data Platforms (with a focus on job orchestration and diagnostics)**.

This GitHub account has been dormant since 2019 because my previous code is on a corporate intranet and I didn't have the energy to contribute to the open source community. **I'm now a freelancer and actively embracing the open source community.**

I define myself as a domain-hopping software engineer currently bouncing between Big Data, Cloud Native, and AI.

**I am also looking for new job opportunities.** As I wish to spend time with my family, I prefer remote or hybrid positions based in mainland China or Hong Kong. If on-site work is required, the position must be based in Xiamen/Fuzhou, Fujian, China.

**You can contact me via richardsucran(at)gmail.com for hiring. I generally check for new emails every two days and send cv to you.**
